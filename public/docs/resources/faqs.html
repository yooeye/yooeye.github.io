<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<h3 id="can-i-use-forge-on-only-part-of-a-page-">Can I use Forge on only part of a page?</h3>
<p>See the <a href="getting-started.html#forge-on-part-of-a-page">advanced topic on using Forge on part of a page</a> on the Getting Started page.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-add-custom-styles-to-a-forge-component-">What is the best way to add custom styles to a Forge component?</h3>
<p>See the <a href="getting-started.html#customizing-css-for-forge-components">advanced topic on customizing CSS for Forge components</a> on the Getting Started page.</p>
<h3 id="does-forge-work-on-mobile-">Does Forge work on mobile?</h3>
<p>The first year of Forge development has prioritized the building of user interface components for web pages for core athenaNet for our set of supported desktop browsers. We have not made specific concessions to use these components on mobile browsers, nor have we undertaken formal testing of the components on mobile browsers. However, all components implemented by the Forge team have taken care to consider multiple viewport widths through a CSS media query based breakpoint system. Forge also supplies 2 components (<a href="../components/grid.html">GridCol and GridRow</a> based on the <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html">Foundation Flex Grid</a>) that can be used to make fluid layouts suitable for mobile web use.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-the-forge-class-names-so-long-">Why are the Forge class names so long?</h3>
<p>Forge adopts a structured and namespaced CSS class naming strategy to handle styling at enterprise-scale and styling that may be forced to live alongside legacy styles. The Forge naming strategy is based on a well-known architecture called <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/">BEM</a>. The following rules are observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS namespace: all classes associated with Forge are prefixed with a global namespace: <code>.fe_</code> to reduce the likelihood that Forge class names exist in stylesheets not deriving from Forge. For example, Bootstrap uses broad names like &#39;row&#39; which if also used by Forge, would create styling conflicts.</li>
<li>Class prefixes: in addition to the <code>.fe_</code> global namespace, Forge adds prefixes to each class to make it more apparent at-a-glance what job that class is doing. The categories of class prefixes are:<ul>
<li><code>c_</code> for UI components, such as <code>.fe_c_button</code></li>
<li><code>l_</code> for layout-related styles, such as <code>.fe_l_grid-row__col</code></li>
<li><code>u_</code> for utilities, such as <code>.fe_u_margin--top-large</code></li>
<li><code>is_</code> for specific states, such as <code>.fe_is-disabled</code></li>
<li><code>f_</code> for features, such as <code>fe_f_typography</code> -- more about feature classes in the <a href="#what-are-feature-classes-">feature classes FAQ</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forge CSS names will otherwise follow BEM standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more on the <a href="https://athenaconfluence.athenahealth.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=143724287">Forge HTML / CSS Guidelines</a> Confluence page.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-feature-classes-">What are feature classes?</h3>
<p>Feature classes are accelerators for applying <em>certain</em> Forge styles to elements in your application. Most Forge styles require specific Forge classes such as <code>fe_c_button</code>. However, putting a Forge-scoped class on every <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> in your application would be a lengthy process. The <code>fe_f_typography</code> class applies standard Forge styles to all the base typographical elements in your page, such as  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><code>fe_f_all</code> is a catch-all feature class that incorporates the styles from all other feature classes. <code>fe_f_all</code> also <strong>must</strong> live at the root of the Forge part of your application, as Forge components are expecting the base typographical styles and normalize styles to be present. Forge components also utilize the <code>fe_f_all</code> class in their CSS selectors.</p>
<h3 id="does-forge-have-a-set-of-common-constants-like-colors-">Does Forge have a set of common constants like colors?</h3>
<p>Depending on what you need to do, you may be able to take advantage of some of Forge&#39;s <a href="../foundations/typography-utilities.html">typography utility classes</a> or <a href="../foundations/layout-utilities.html">layout utility classes</a> to get the standard styles you&#39;re looking for onto your components.</p>
<p>If you do need access to the Forge colors as variables (e.g. to output within your own classes for application-specific components), all of Forge&#39;s colors are represented within semantic <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps">Sass variable maps</a>. (<a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is a CSS preprocessor that allows for things like variables and functions with CSS). The <a href="../foundations/color.html">color page</a> lists the syntax to access each color in that color&#39;s palette swatch, e.g. <code>map-get($color-interaction, default)</code>.</p>
<p>For those getters to work, you will need to import all the Forge constants first in your main <code>.scss</code> file via:</p>
<code><pre><span class="hljs-attribute">import</span> <span class="hljs-string">'<span class="hljs-variable">@athena</span>/forge/sass/forge-abstracts'</span>;</pre></code><p>You may need to add &#39;node_modules&#39; to the include path for your Sass compiler, depending on your setup.</p>
<p>If you started from <a href="https://bitbucket.athenahealth.com/projects/UXDS/repos/forge-app/browse">forge-app</a>, you should already have access to the Forge constants set up in your  index.scss file.</p>
<p>Other common constants available in Forge as Sass maps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Font sizes</li>
<li>Font weights</li>
<li>Standard margin sizes</li>
<li>Standard padding sizes</li>
<li>Breakpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the standard margin and padding constants are available in JavaScript from the <a href="https://gitlab.athenahealth.com/design-systems/forge/blob/master/js/constants.js">JS constants file</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-forge-workspace-">What is the Forge Workspace?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://design-systems.pages.athenahealth.com/forge/">Forge workspace</a> is the development environment for Forge. It is based on <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">storybook</a> and offers certain developer-leaning features like <a href="https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs">knobs</a>. It does not provide the design, usage, and implementation guidance that Forge Guide does, and should only be used in conjunction with Forge Guide.</p>
<h3 id="is-forge-tied-to-redux-do-i-have-to-use-redux-to-use-forge-">Is Forge tied to Redux? Do I have to use Redux to use Forge?</h3>
<p>In order to provide conveniences like validation in Forge forms, there needed to be a state management architecture in place. Redux is a very popular one both within and external to athena, and Redux Form is a vetted and popular add-on to Redux that focuses on form management. (Learn more about <a href="https://athenaconfluence.athenahealth.com/display/UXDS/Evaluating+Third-party+Libraries+for+use+in+Forge">how Forge evaluates third-party libraries</a>.) However, <a href="../components/form.html"><code>Form</code></a> and <a href="../components/form-field.html"><code>FormField</code></a> (as opposed to <a href="../components/redux-form.html"><code>ReduxForm</code></a> and <a href="../components/redux-form-field.html"><code>ReduxFormField</code></a>) exist specifically to provide an opt-out option from the Redux / Redux Form architecture. These components are actually the styling / layout building blocks for their Redux counterparts, and are agnostic to the state management architecture you choose to adopt.</p>

The transition to the look and feel will be intentionally gradual.\r\n#### New products / workflows\r\nUsing Forge is recommended as it should expedite your design and build process and, if applied correctly, will ensure higher usability.\r\n\r\n{{#> notify}}\r\n  {{#*inline \"content\"}}\r\n  <p>[Please let us know]({{ path 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcIpTL2d5TOhjnqi7KFfZLXJmirccMe4-eVjFbkJ_lPQJp_Q/viewform' }}) if you plan to use Forge for any 18.7 GA release work so we can help with applying it and monitoring impact.</p>\r\n  {{/inline}}\r\n{{/notify}}\r\n\r\n### How do I contact the Forge team?\r\nGet in touch over Slack by joining [#our-design-system](slack://channel?team=T02SKNTG5&id=C4HB0RJDN) for product / design topics and [#forge-dev](slack://channel?team=T02SKNTG5&id=C5HNL586R) for technical topics.\r\n\r\n### What are the latest updates to Forge?\r\nAll published releases of Forge are tagged; each tag lists the updates included in that release.
