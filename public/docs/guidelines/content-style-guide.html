        <p class="p--lead">Consistency in style and voice helps our users feel more comfortable, place greater trust in us, and use our products more efficiently. Our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3QwbsZhGIAHenFVNFlkbl81S0E/view">UX Content Style Guide</a> allows us to keep track of our precedents to ensure we’re creating a seamless experience for our users. It also prevents us from having to make the same decisions over and over again.</p>

<p>In addition to this style guide, we use the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> for broader stylistic choices and the <em>Microsoft Manual of Style</em> for software and UI conventions.</p>
<h2 id="principles-and-guidelines">Principles and Guidelines</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>At a high level, UI content should drive behavior and be clear, concise, and consistent. UI content shouldn’t distract; in fact, content should be so simple, straightforward, and intuitive that it becomes almost invisible.
Here are some general guidelines to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use simple and direct sentences and labeling that support the experience.</li>
<li>Eliminate extraneous instruction and labeling. If something looks complex, it might as well be.</li>
<li>Consider your audience and adjust tone based on context.</li>
<li>Remove ambiguity by anticipating users’ needs and questions and providing just-in-time guidance.</li>
<li>Counter complexity by aiming for a 6th-8th grade reading level.</li>
<li>Motivate users by focusing on positive outcomes and progress, not negative consequences.</li>
<li>Maintain a voice that is friendly and empathetic; conversational, but not casual; direct, but not impersonal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="be-concise">Be concise</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to include all information that a user could ever potentially need to know about a task, and to spell out every edge case. But the more information you add the less clear the content becomes. Limit content to only what the user needs to know to complete the task at hand. Effective UI writing is as much about removing words as it is adding them.</p>
<h3 id="remember-to-">Remember to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be specific.</li>
<li>Use short sentences.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> The team knows many different methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> The team has knowledge of many different methodologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use contractions.</li>
<li>Make your verbs direct.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> The team knows many different methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> The team has knowledge of many different methodologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reconsider prepositional phrases.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> The participant’s opinion...</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> The opinion of the participant...</li>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> Each <strong>of</strong> us likes something different <strong>from</strong> the café.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> It is a matter <strong>of</strong> personal preference <strong>to</strong> each <strong>of</strong> us here <strong>at</strong> athenahealth <strong>as far as</strong> what our lunches <strong>at</strong> the café are made <strong>of</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid overly long/pointless phrases when shorter ones will do.<ul>
<li><strong>Do this:</strong> I am running a study on OB episodes.</li>
<li><strong>Not this:</strong> I am running a study concerning the matter of OB episodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to save space (e.g., in a table where the column consists of dates, &quot;Modified&quot; can be used instead of &quot;Modified Date&quot; as the column heading).
*Avoid wrapping to a new line for one (or two) words. Edit copy to fit allotted space.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simple-language"><strong>Simple language</strong></h3>
<p>Our users span a wide array of demographics, geographies, and education levels. Because of that, it’s important to write clearly and simply. Simple language is easier for everyone to understand. Avoid jargon, and shoot for a 6th to 8th grade reading level. If you’re unsure, <a href="https://readable.io/">test your usability</a>.</p>
<h3 id="active-voice"><strong>Active voice</strong></h3>
<p>Using the active voice gives your sentences precision and strength. Try to avoid using the passive voice as much as possible.</p>
<p>In sentences written using the active voice, the subject of the sentence <em>performs</em> the action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active:</strong> Mike submitted the proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sentences written using the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive:</strong> The proposal was submitted by Mike.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example sentence written in the active voice is shorter, clearer, and more direct.</p>
